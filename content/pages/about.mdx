Arina Berezovsky is a systems innovator, writer, and ex-startup founder. In 2021, she founded Let Me Graduate, an aggregated directory of articulation agreements between colleges and learning opportunity providers, to increase access to higher education by informing students of alternative pathways to degree attainment. The project was turned into a non-profit, community-driven initiative which can be found [here](https://letmegraduate.softr.app/).

Arina graduated from Excelsior College in 2021 with a Bachelor of Science degree. Her professional interests stem from her personal experience navigating the U.S. higher education system. Arina's degree is a combination of learning opportunities spanning over a dozen providers earned between the ages of 14 and 25 - representing both the flexibility and complexity of navigating the pathway to a degree.
